    "\n",
    "1.  **Save Your Work:** Click the **\"Save Version\"** button in the top-right corner of the notebook editor.\n",
    "2.  **Run the Notebook:** In the pop-up window, select **\"Save & Run All (Commit)\"** and then click the **\"Save\"** button. This will run your entire notebook from top to bottom and save the output, including your `submission.csv` file.\n",
    "3.  **Go to the Viewer:** Once the save process is complete, navigate to the notebook viewer page. \n",
    "4.  **Submit to Competition:** In the viewer, find the **\"Submit to Competition\"** section. This is usually located in the header of the output section or in the vertical \"...\" menu on the right side of the page. Clicking the **Submit** button this will submit your generated `submission.csv` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "After submitting, you will see your score in the **\"Submit to Competition\"** section or in the [Public Leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/fds-pokemon-battles-prediction-2025/leaderboard?).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method B: Manual Upload\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also generate your predictions and submission file using any environment you prefer (this notebook, Google Colab, or your local machine).\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Generate the `submission.csv` file** using your model.\n",
    "2.  **Download the file** to your computer.\n",
    "3.  **Navigate to the [Leaderboard Page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/fds-pokemon-battles-prediction-2025/leaderboard?)** and click on the **\"Submit Predictions\"** button.\n",
    "4.  **Upload Your File:** Drag and drop or select your `submission.csv` file to upload it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is quick, but keep in mind that for the final evaluation, you might be required to provide the code that generated your submission.\n",
